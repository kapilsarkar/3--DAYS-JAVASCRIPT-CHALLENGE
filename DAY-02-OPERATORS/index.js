//Activity-1: Arithmetic Operators


//Task-1 : Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
let addNum1 = 10
let addNum2 = 20
let addResult = addNum1 + addNum2

//Task-2 : Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
let subNum1 = 20
let subNum2 = 10
let subResult = subNum1 - subNum2

//Task-3 : Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
let mulNum1 = 30
let mulNum2 = 20
let mulResult = mulNum1 * mulNum2

//Task-4 : Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
let divNum1 = 50
